# Developing locally
- Install https://www.mono-project.com/download/preview/#download-lin
- Open as top-level directory in Visual Studio Code
- Disable or uninstall C# dev kit
- As per: https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp

Note: the above does not seem to work for me, building in CLI works fine, but I use Rider to open this from windows
